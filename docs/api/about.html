<h3 id="what-is-this-for-">What is this for?</h3>
<p>This is for sites that are super-simple but require loading some page content
independently of the rest.</p>
<p>Maybe one part loads slowly and it&#39;s dragging the rest of the page down with
it. Maybe some boilerplate can be cached indefinitely and doesn&#39;t need to be
downloaded on every page view.</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;remote-div.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;remote-div data-src=&quot;/partial-page.html&quot;&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre><p>It&#39;s that easy. This is what it does:</p>
<ol>
<li>Registers a new HTML element <code>registerElement(&#39;remote-div&#39;)</code></li>
<li>Fetches the HTML document specified with the <code>data-src</code> attribute.</li>
<li>Injects the HTML into the <code>remote-div</code></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="styling-with-css">Styling with CSS</h3>
<p>There a few lifecycle events that you can style in your css if you wish.
Here&#39;s a starting point:</p>
<pre><code>remote-div {
    display: block;
}
remote-div[data-stage=&quot;loading&quot;]:before {
    content: &#39;Here comes your content!!!&#39;;
}
remote-div[data-stage=&quot;error&quot;]:before {
    content: &#39;Oh no, your content failed to load :(&#39;;
}

<p>Yeah, there may be problems with client-side-includesâ€¦ take it or leave it.
It&#39;s just a tiny project I found useful once.</p>
<h4 id="are-there-js-lifecycle-events-">Are there JS lifecycle events?</h4>
<p>Not at the moment. I didn&#39;t have a need for them, but I can imagine they may
be useful. Send a pull request if you are so inclined!</p>
